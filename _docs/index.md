CutSMS is the external platform. It combines three main modules.

{: .note .info} 
Frontend<br>
Management system for [signals](), [indicators]() and [models]()

The database system stores the structure of predefined signals, indicators, and models across domains (e.g., Economy, Investment, Production). This module collects new data for active signals from multiple sources at regular intervals.
