What can you do with Jekyll?

You can use Jekyll to create static websites and blogs from Markdown and HTML files. 

Jekyll's features include: 

* Templating: Use Liquid, a templating language that loads dynamic content
* Layouts: Choose from built-in layouts to structure your site
* Styling: Use stylesheets to change the look and feel of your site
* Content management: Create, edit, and preview your content
* Publishing: Publish your site to GitHub Pages for free

Jekyll is a static site generator, which means that it creates pages that load faster than dynamic pages. 

It's also simple to use and doesn't require a database. 

How to use Jekyll?

* Run gem install bundler jekyll
* Run jekyll new my-awesome-site
* Run cd my-awesome-site
* Run bundle exec jekyll serve
* Browse to http://localhost:4000

You can configure Jekyll settings, like your site's theme and plugins, by editing your _config.yml file.
