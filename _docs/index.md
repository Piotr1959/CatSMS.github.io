CutSMS operates as an external platform accessible through RDP protocol. The system integrates three core functional modules.

{: .note .info} 
Frontend<br>
Management system for [signals](), [indicators]() and [models]()


{: .note .info} 
Backend<br>
The database system stores the structure of predefined signals, indicators, and models across domains (e.g., Investment, Economy, Production). This module collects new data for active signals from multiple sources at regular intervals.
